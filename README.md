# School_Schedule

## Created by Dimitra Kourli

Using Java I implemented a genetic algorithm which I used in order to create the school's schedule. This algorithm works with a population 
of chromosomes that have a certain score (score depends on the requirements of the schedule that are satisfied). Chromosomes with higher 
scores are more likely to be chosen in order to create a child which will be added to the population. The algorithm keeps repeating until 
it finds the chromosome whose score crosses a given threshold.
